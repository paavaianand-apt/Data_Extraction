PROGRAM NAME: Test Functions for Sprint 3
AUTHOR(S): L. Adithi
VERSION AND DATE: 3.1 | August 17, 2024

PURPOSE: 
This module contains test functions designed to validate the RTF processing system as part of Sprint 3. The test scenarios address special character handling in rtf files ans ways to differentitate from delimiters/separators.

TEST SCENARIOS:

URS ID : KEX002.4.1
1. "The system should have the capability to extract any special
characters in any data point (column header, row header,
header, footer, body/content) eg (, -, ?, :) and fit it in the
knowledge graph database and processing requirement to
be met by transforming the source data special character
into acceptable data and vice versa when display the data
in system"

URS ID : KEX002.4.20
2. "The system should have the ability to differentiate and
extract List files Row/Column values which are containing
special characters different from delimiters/separators."

URS ID : KEX002.4.21
3. "The system should have the ability to differentiate and
extract Table files Row/Column values which are containing
special characters different from delimiters/separators."

Generic Test Cases:
   - Validation of RTF file integrity.
   - Schema validation for RTF files.
   - Conversion process from RTF to JSON or other required formats.
   - Extraction of basic data components of the file as seen in sprint-1
